        Happy birthday to an old lady who still knows how to party!<br>
        You’re still hot after all these years, but not as hot as your cake with all those candles!<br>
        Your birthday is the perfect time to recognize all your wonderful qualities, including the fact that you’re older than me.<br>

    <p>Happy Birthday to the woman who's the peanut butter to my jelly, the sock to my shoe, the gin to my tonic. I don't know what I'd do without you!
        Just like you've always been there for me through life's ups and downs, I'll always be there for you. Happy Birthday!
        Happy Birthday to my utterly and absolutely irreplaceable best friend.
        Here is your yearly reminder that there is no better bestie than you! Happy birthday, my girl!</p>
